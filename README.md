## 📚 Project Overview

This project is part of a major assignment for the Data Science and Machine Learning course.  
It focuses on predicting oil spills using a real-world dataset and applying the full machine learning pipeline.

---

## 🚀 Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing:
  - Handle null values
  - Apply one-hot encoding and imputation
  - Scale features as required

- Derive meaningful insights from the dataset

- Apply various machine learning techniques, including:
  - Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.
  - Bagging and ensemble techniques

- Evaluate models using standard evaluation techniques (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc.) and select the best one

- Save the best-performing model for future use

- Load the saved model and apply it to a new dataset with 20 randomly sampled data points

## 💻 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
  https://github.com/Tawade-123/Machine-Learning.git



  If you want, I can also generate:
✅ `requirements.txt` (with the exact Python dependencies)  
✅ `.gitignore` (to keep the repo clean)  

Would you like me to prepare those as well? Let me know! 🌟
